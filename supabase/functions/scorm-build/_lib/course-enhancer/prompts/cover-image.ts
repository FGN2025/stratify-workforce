/**
 * Cover image prompt — generates a photoreal, cinematic, machinery-led
 * scene that matches the real FGN brand visual language used on
 * play.fgn.gg challenge cards and the fgn.academy hero.
 *
 * v4 — calibrated against actual FGN production imagery (May 2026).
 *
 * Reference: the user provided four screenshots showing live brand
 * images — Construction Sim challenge grid, Farming Sim challenge
 * grid, ATS challenge grid, fgn.academy "Master Fiber Optics" hero.
 * Synthesizing what they share:
 *
 *   1. PHOTOREAL or photoreal-painterly. Looks like a cinematic
 *      photograph or a high-end concept-art render. NOT stylized
 *      illustration, NOT cartoon, NOT vector.
 *
 *   2. Workers WELCOME in the frame. Hi-vis vests, hardhats, gloves,
 *      eye protection. They are caught mid-task — surveying with
 *      tablets, signaling cranes, splicing fiber, climbing into cabs.
 *      Faces are often partially obscured by hardhats, side angles, or
 *      attention focused downward at the work. NEVER posed at-camera.
 *      NEVER stock-photo "happy worker shaking hands" energy.
 *
 *   3. Natural time-of-day lighting drives the mood. Golden hour,
 *      dusk, dawn, stormy skies, sodium-vapor work lights at night.
 *      The brand's UI mode (arcade vs enterprise) is for HTML chrome
 *      surrounding the image — it does NOT impose a cyan or violet
 *      filter on the image itself. Production cards span the full
 *      lighting spectrum.
 *
 *   4. Equipment in CONTEXT. Real worksites — dirt and rebar, fields
 *      with crops, highways with traffic lines, utility poles with
 *      cables. Equipment never floats in abstract dark space.
 *
 *   5. In-game HUD overlays are part of the brand. Color-coded
 *      grading maps, soil sampling indicators, GPS overlays, dash
 *      tablets. These are scene-appropriate visual elements — NOT
 *      forbidden as "data visualizations." They distinguish FGN
 *      sim-derived training from generic stock work imagery.
 *
 *   6. Brand chrome lives in the HTML overlay (game label badge,
 *      difficulty pill, course title in Orbitron, FGN wordmark) —
 *      NOT in the image. So: NO TEXT in the image.
 *
 * Adding a new game = add one line to GAME_SCENES. No code change.

    'a Class 8 American semi-truck in real working context — could be highway at dusk with mountain silhouettes, a stormy mountain pass, a dock yard under sodium-vapor work lights, or a rest stop at dawn. Three-quarter angle on the truck. The driver may appear in cab profile (hands on wheel, partial face obscured) or doing a pre-trip inspection with clipboard in proper hi-vis vest — never posed at camera. Real CDL-relevant detail: load straps, mud flaps, DOT signage, road shoulder geometry, weigh station context. Photoreal cinematic.',
  Farming_Sim:
    'modern agricultural equipment in real field context — combine harvester crossing a vibrant golden wheat or corn field, large tractor with planter or seeder kicking up dust, applicator spraying with precision-ag GPS overlay, or grain truck at the elevator. Time of day varies (golden hour, dawn, after a rain). May include in-game HUD overlay — Precision Farming yield map, soil-pH zone visualization, nitrogen-status colors — as a scene-appropriate technological element. Operator may appear in cab profile or with a tablet in hi-vis vest, hardhat, or cap. Photoreal cinematic agriculture.',
  Construction_Sim:
    'heavy civil construction equipment on an active worksite — choose one specific scenario: a yellow hydraulic excavator mid-dig with rebar and dirt visible, a bulldozer grading with the in-game green/red Construction View color overlay on the ground, a wheel loader pouring into a CAT articulated dump truck, a road paver mid-pass at night with sodium-vapor lights and a paving crew in hi-vis, a mobile crane lifting a beam under a stormy sky, a concrete pump placing concrete on a high-rise deck, or a demolition rig with fire-glow and dust. Workers in proper PPE (hardhats, hi-vis, eye protection) may be present, caught mid-task with attention on their work — never posed. Photoreal cinematic. Time of day matches the scenario.',
  Mechanic_Sim:
    'an automotive workshop scene — a meticulously detailed engine bay viewed from above with valve cover off and intake manifold visible under bright shop lights, OR a car on a lift with a mechanic working underneath caught from a low angle (boots and gloved hands visible, face obscured by the chassis), OR a precision diagnostic scene with OBD-II tools and the laptop showing live data. Tools, oil sheen, work lights, organized clutter of a real shop. Photoreal cinematic.',
  Roadcraft:
    'a heavy off-road recovery rig — articulated hauler, mud-spattered recovery winch truck, or amphibious crane — moving through a rugged storm-cleared landscape. Wet earth, partially restored infrastructure (downed poles, washed-out road), overcast natural lighting with breaking sunlight. Operator visible in cab profile (face obscured by hardhat or focus on controls) or signaling another rig — proper PPE, mid-task. Photoreal cinematic disaster-recovery feel.',
  Fiber_Tech:
    'a fiber-optic technician at work in real broadband infrastructure context — kneeling at the base of a utility pole splicing fiber on a portable fusion splicer at golden hour, or in a bucket truck securing a strand under sunset light, or running cables out of a fiber spool truck. Worker is in proper PPE (hi-vis, hardhat, eye protection, gloves) and the focus is on the work and equipment — fiber strands, splicer screen, optical test meter — not on the worker as a portrait. Real broadband details: utility pole hardware, bucket truck boom, fiber spools, OTDR equipment. Photoreal cinematic — matches the established fgn.academy hero aesthetic.',
